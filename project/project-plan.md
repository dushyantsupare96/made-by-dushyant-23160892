# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
MADE SoSE-24 - Correlation between Climate change and Internal displacement around the world.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How does Climate change- that is rise in surface temeperatures affect or aggravate the Internal displacemnent around the world?
## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

Climate change, particularly the rise in surface temperatures, significantly contributes to internal displacement worldwide. As temperatures increase, the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires also rise. These events can devastate communities, destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing people to relocate within their countries. Additionally, gradual environmental changes like sea-level rise and desertification reduce the availability of habitable and arable land, pushing populations to migrate in search of better living conditions. These shifts often lead to overcrowding in safer areas, competition for resources, and potential conflict, further exacerbating the challenges of internal displacement.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefix "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Global Surface Teperatures
* MetaData URL: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset is very Huge ranging from 1700's and has various CSV files, the work here would be based on country, which country has the highest displacement rate, that would be judged on the basis of rising surface temperatures.

### Datasource2: Number if Internally Displaced people by the country
* MetaData URL: [Natural Disasters](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset represent the number of internally displaced people from 2008-2023
